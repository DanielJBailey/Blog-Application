The route circled the borders of France and, on that particular year, cyclists were forced to climb the mountains in the East of the country twice, once at the start of the race and once at the end, an unprecedented occurrence in the competition.\n\n 126 cyclists competed in the race, pedaling through trails of wet mud of which the classic 1920’s French automobile, the Citroen, got stuck trying to follow along the winding, mountainous routes. To this day, it remains the longest Tour de France ever contrived in the history of the event.Not far from the finish line lay situated the University of Paris, metonymically known as Sorbonne. Within the confines of those intricately designed, cathedral-like walls, three geniuses came to agree upon a riveting concept known as the noösphere. \n\n Edouard Le Roy (philosopher), Pierre Teilhard de Chardin (paleontologist) and Vladimir Vernadsky (geochemist) agreed upon their conceptualization of a sphere of human thought — the noösphere — in the sense of a lexical analogy to the geosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere.\n\n Alan Watts, speaking on the subject half a century later, may have summed it up best when he described how it ought to be regarded:\n\n“Earth as a geosphere is covered with a biosphere — that is the sphere of living organisms. The biosphere in turn generates the noösphere which is the communication network that we call the mind. Through literature, through speech, through radio and television communication, the noösphere is slowly realized.”\n\nThe word is derived from the Greek word “nous” (mind) and “sphaira” (sphere). It provokes the realization that there exists a high-energy layer of human thought and connectivity that is constructed upon the natural world. It is a nervous system, a shroud of mental inter-connectivity to which we become more and more dependent upon as we detach from the primitive ways of our ancestors. It is fashioned from and by knowledge, exponentially generating more and more information that propels us to unrealized heights of existence.\n\n“It is our duty as men and women to proceed as though the limits of our abilities do not exist.” — Pierre Teilhard de Chardin.\n\n Now, this was fathomed in 1926 (and arguably as early as 1922). In any event, we’re getting to the doorstep of the century mark from whence this theory was conceptualized. Even Alan Watts, discussing it several decades before the idea of the internet was even brought into being, had been amazed at how the noösphere was materializing so effectively through the use of radio and television connectivity. It would be fascinating to see what the above-mentioned individuals would say about this now, but that’s getting away from the point.\n\nThe idea of the noösphere is awe-inspiring in itself not only because of what it proposes, but the way in which it frames our advancement as a civilization. Rather than foraging for information as our ancestors did, we modern humans have come to master it. We’ve found a way to manipulate, proliferate and propagate not only information but the channels through which it flows. As we’re knocking on the doors of 5G network installations and snapping increasingly detailed photos of the cosmos, mining asteroids and sequencing genetics, we may be taking for granted the speed at which data and knowledge can travel — which is on the verge of immediacy.\n\n“The time has come to realise that an interpretation of the universe — even a positivist one — remains unsatisfying unless it covers the interior as well as the exterior of things; mind as well as matter. The true physics is that which will, one day, achieve the inclusion of man in his wholeness in a coherent picture of the world.” ― Pierre Teilhard de Chardin."}],
